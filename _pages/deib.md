[ZIGI](https://www.zuckermanzigi.com/)\
Women and gender minorities are underrepresented in science. As a member of the leadership team of Columbia's Zuckerman Institute Gender Inclusion group, I plan and organize a book club aimed at creating an equitable environment for everyone in the institution. Recent examples include books on [ally training](https://www.workplaceallies.com/books/goodguys) and [lived experience](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262539548/the-autobiography-of-a-transgender-scientist/) perspectives of gender minorities in science.

[BUMP](https://www.bumpbiology.org/)\
I serve as a research mentor in the black undergraduate mentorship program. BUMP aims to assist black undergraduates interested in pursuing careers in science and medicine by connecting them to researchers at Columbia that can answer career questions, assist with applications for internships, and help them build their professional network.
