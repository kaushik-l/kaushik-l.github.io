I am a postdoc in the [center for theoretical neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University's Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute and a [BBRF](https://bbrfoundation.org/) young investigator. I am interested in understanding the mechanisms of learning and decision-making across different domains including perception, motor control, and navigation. I borrow ideas from psychology, neuroscience, statistics and machine learning to develop computational theories and analysis methods and apply them to data in close collaboration with experimentalists. Previously, I was involved in designing and carrying out some of my own experiments.
